Caution: A higher condition number may result in a poor metamorph.
Note: Condition number will increase with more control points added.
      The condition number may be improved by selecting different control points.

4666 occurences of a non-integrable function used in xFitter due to Sc(0)
2206 occurences of a non-integrable function used in xFitter due to Sc(1)

Check best-fit Sc(1) and Sc(2) values in Fantomas output files to ensure xf(x) for all flavors is integrable.

Sc(1) and Sc(1) should be greater than 0.07
