Condition number for matrix T in metamorph for ifl= 0 is: 22.628
Condition number for matrix T in metamorph for ifl= 1 is: 284.742
Condition number for matrix T in metamorph for ifl= 2 is: 284.742

Caution: A higher condition number may result in a poor metamorph.
Note: Condition number will increase with more control points added.
      The condition number may be improved by selecting different control points.

3 occurences of a non-integrable function used in xFitter due to Sc(0)
1 occurences of a non-integrable function used in xFitter due to Sc(1)

Check best-fit Sc(1) and Sc(2) values in Fantomas output files to ensure xf(x) for all flavors is integrable.

Sc(1) and Sc(1) should be greater than 0.07
